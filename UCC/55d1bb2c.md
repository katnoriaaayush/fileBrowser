# AI-Powered Project Documentation Assistant

## Project Definition

### Background
Engineering teams often face significant challenges in creating and maintaining comprehensive documentation for complex software projects. Manual documentation of APIs, high-level and low-level designs (HLD/LLD), architecture diagrams, and use case diagrams is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Teams using Confluence or other wiki platforms must also manually organize pages into coherent tree structures, which adds overhead and delays to product delivery.

### Purpose & Goal
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-driven solution that automatically analyzes a software project's repository structure, codebase, and configuration files to generate and maintain up-to-date technical documentation. This includes:

- API reference docs
- Use Case Diagrams
- High-Level Design (HLD) Diagrams
- Low-Level Design (LLD) Diagrams
- Overall Architecture Diagrams
- Organized Confluence pages with hierarchical tree structure

### Overview
The solution integrates with source code repositories (e.g., Git), CI/CD pipelines, and Confluence APIs. Upon each code commit or on-demand trigger, the AI engine:

1. Parses repository metadata, code comments, and configuration files.
2. Extracts API definitions, module interactions, and architectural components.
3. Generates UML diagrams (use case, HLD, LLD) using graph modeling libraries.
4. Constructs human-readable documentation sections.
5. Pushes or updates Confluence pages, organizing them into a pre-defined tree structure.


## Expected Outcomes

### Target Users

- Software Engineers & Developers
- DevOps Engineers
- Technical Writers
- Engineering Managers
- QA Engineers

### Expected Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Automates repetitive documentation tasks, freeing engineers to focus on development.
- **Consistency & Accuracy**: Ensures up-to-date and uniform documentation across the project lifecycle.
- **Improved Onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand system structure and APIs.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Centralized, well-organized Confluence pages facilitate cross-team communication.
- **Reduced Maintenance Overhead**: Documentation stays in sync with code changes automatically.

## Scalability

- **Multi-Repo Support**: Capable of handling mono-repos and polyrepos across multiple languages and frameworks.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Allows addition of custom parsers for new languages or frameworks.
- **Distributed Processing**: Scales horizontally to support large enterprise codebases without performance degradation.
- **Multi-Tenant Deployment**: Deployable in cloud environments with tenant isolation for different teams or projects.

## Additional Use Cases

1. **Compliance & Audit Reporting**: Automatically generate compliance documentation (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by mapping data flows and APIs to regulatory requirements.
2. **Release Notes Generation**: Summarize changes between versions by analyzing commit messages and diff files.
3. **Security Posture Analysis**: Identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies and embed security findings into documentation.
4. **Dependency Graph Visualization**: Produce interactive graphs showing module and service dependencies.
5. **Test Coverage Reports**: Integrate with testing frameworks to document test suites, coverage metrics, and quality gates.
6. **On-the-Fly Glossary & Indexing**: Extract and define domain-specific terms, creating a project glossary and index.
7. **Automated FAQ Generation**: Analyze issue trackers and documentation to generate an FAQ section for Confluence.
